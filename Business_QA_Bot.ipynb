Class arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are prohibited. Only individual relief is available. The parties agree to sever and litigate in court any request for public injunctive relief after completing arbitration for the underlying claim and all other claims. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement. You and OpenAI knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim. **Batch arbitration.** If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within 90 days of each other, then you and OpenAI agree that NAM will administer them in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”), unless there are less than 50 claimants in total or after batching, which will comprise a single Batch. NAM will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing held by videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for each Batch. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed and arbitrated in individual proceedings. **Severability.** If any part of these arbitration terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class arbitration, class action, or representative action, this entire dispute resolution section will be unenforceable in its entirety.

Techniques like learning from human feedback are helping us get closer, and we are actively researching new techniques to help us fill the gaps.” Josh Achiam, Researcher at OpenAI ### Focus areas We build our generative models using a technology called deep learning, which leverages large amounts of data to train an AI system to perform a task. Text ---- Our text models are advanced language processing tools that can generate, classify, and summarize text with high levels of coherence and accuracy.

We hope to help users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search. For decades, search has been a foundational way for publishers and creators to reach users. Now, we’re using AI to enhance this experience by highlighting high quality content in a conversational interface with multiple opportunities for users to engage. “AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers. We look forward to partnering with OpenAI in the process, and creating a new way for readers to discover The Atlantic.” Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic SearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by prominently citing and linking to them in searches. Responses have clear, in-line, named attribution and links so users know where information is coming from and can quickly engage with even more results in a sidebar with source links. ![SearchGPT Prototype > Media > Publishers Asset Media Item](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/66ekdPwegMqXhIJHfoLdx1/56961043cda6c09f624388022505b0f7/SearchGPT_Publishers_V2.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp) We’ve partnered with publishers to build this experience and continue to seek their feedback. In addition to launching the SearchGPT prototype, we are also launching a way for publishers to manage how they appear in SearchGPT, so publishers have more choices. Importantly, SearchGPT is about search and is separate from training OpenAI’s generative AI foundation models. Sites can be surfaced in search results even if they opt out of generative AI training. To read more about publisher controls and OpenAI’s bots, see [here(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots) . We’ve also heard from publishers and creators that they want to understand how best to engage with AI search products and how their content performs. We’ll use this prototype to learn more and share findings. If you’d like to share feedback, please email us at publishers-feedback@openai.com. “Sam and the truly talented team at OpenAI innately understand that for AI-powered search to be effective, it must be founded on the highest-quality, most reliable information furnished by trusted sources. For the heavens to be in equilibrium, the relationship between technology and content must be symbiotic and provenance must be protected.” Robert Thomson, Chief Executive, News Corp What comes next --------------- We’ll keep improving the experience in areas like local information and commerce. We also plan to get feedback on the prototype from users and publishers and bring the best of the experience into ChatGPT.

We plan to roll out fine-tuning for GPT-4o mini in the coming days. In ChatGPT, Free, Plus and Team users will be able to access GPT-4o mini starting today, in place of GPT-3.5. Enterprise users will also have access starting next week, in line with our mission to make the benefits of AI accessible to all. What’s Next ----------- Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed remarkable advancements in AI intelligence paired with substantial reductions in cost. For example, the cost per token of GPT-4o mini has dropped by 99% since text-davinci-003, a less capable model introduced in 2022. We’re committed to continuing this trajectory of driving down costs while enhancing model capabilities. We envision a future where models become seamlessly integrated in every app and on every website. GPT-4o mini is paving the way for developers to build and scale powerful AI applications more efficiently and affordably. The future of AI is becoming more accessible, reliable, and embedded in our daily digital experiences, and we’re excited to continue to lead the way.

The timeline to AGI remains uncertain, but our Charter will guide us in acting in the best interests of humanity throughout its development. OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity. We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome. To that end, we commit to the following principles: #### Broadly distributed benefits We commit to use any influence we obtain over AGI’s deployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all, and to avoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power. Our primary fiduciary duty is to humanity. We anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to fulfill our mission, but will always diligently act to minimize conflicts of interest among our employees and stakeholders that could compromise broad benefit. #### Long-term safety We are committed to doing the research required to make AGI safe, and to driving the broad adoption of such research across the AI community. We are concerned about late-stage AGI development becoming a competitive race without time for adequate safety precautions. Therefore, if a value-aligned, safety-conscious project comes close to building AGI before we do, we commit to stop competing with and start assisting this project. We will work out specifics in case-by-case agreements, but a typical triggering condition might be “a better-than-even chance of success in the next two years.” #### Technical leadership To be effective at addressing AGI’s impact on society, OpenAI must be on the cutting edge of AI capabilities—policy and safety advocacy alone would be insufficient. We believe that AI will have broad societal impact before AGI, and we’ll strive to lead in those areas that are directly aligned with our mission and expertise. #### Cooperative orientation We will actively cooperate with other research and policy institutions; we seek to create a global community working together to address AGI’s global challenges. We are committed to providing public goods that help society navigate the path to AGI. Today this includes publishing most of our AI research, but we expect that safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future, while increasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards research.

It can be challenging to implement this constraining in practice, since the tokens that are valid differ throughout a model’s output. Let’s say we have the following schema: **JSON** ` 12345678 1 { 2 \"type\": \"object\", 3 \"properties\": { 4 \"value\": { \"type\": \"number\" } 5 }, 6 \"required\": [\"value\"], 7 \"additionalProperties\": false 8 } ` The tokens that are valid at the beginning of the output include things like `{`, `{“`, `{\\\\n`, etc. However, once the model has already sampled `{“val`, then `{` is no longer a valid token. Thus we need to implement dynamic constrained decoding, and determine which tokens are valid after each token is generated, rather than upfront at the beginning of the response. To do this, we convert the supplied JSON Schema into a context-free grammar (CFG). A grammar is a set of rules that defines a language, and a context-free grammar is a grammar that conforms to specific rules. You can think of JSON and JSON Schema as particular languages with rules to define what is valid within the language. Just as it’s not valid in English to have a sentence with no verb, it is not valid in JSON to have a trailing comma. Thus, for each JSON Schema, we compute a grammar that represents that schema, and pre-process its components to make it easily accessible during model sampling. This is why the first request with a new schema incurs a latency penalty—we must preprocess the schema to generate this artifact that we can use efficiently during sampling. While sampling, after every token, our inference engine will determine which tokens are valid to be produced next based on the previously generated tokens and the rules within the grammar that indicate which tokens are valid next. We then use this list of tokens to mask the next sampling step, which effectively lowers the probability of invalid tokens to 0. Because we have preprocessed the schema, we can use a cached data structure to do this efficiently, with minimal latency overhead. Alternate approaches -------------------- Alternate approaches to this problem often use finite state machines (FSMs) or regexes (generally implemented with FSMs) for constrained decoding. These function similarly in that they dynamically update which tokens are valid after each token is produced, but they have some key differences from the CFG approach. Notably, CFGs can express a broader class of languages than FSMs. In practice, this doesn’t matter for very simple schemas like the `value` schema shown above. However, we find that the difference is meaningful for more complex schemas that involve nested or recursive data structures. As an example, FSMs cannot generally express recursive types, which means FSM based approaches may struggle to match parentheses in deeply nested JSON. The following is a sample recursive schema that is supported on the OpenAI API with Structured Outputs but would not be possible to express with a FSM. **JSON** ` 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445 1 { 2 \"name\": \"ui\", 3 \"description\": \"Dynamically generated UI\", 4 \"strict\": true, 5', '170 | | Total tokens | 255 | | Total price | $0.000638 | \\\\*Batch API pricing requires requests to be submitted as a batch.
